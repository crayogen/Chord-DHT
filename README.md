# Chord-DHT
An implementation of the Chord distrubuted hash table in Ruby, as decribed in the paper "Chord: A Scalable Peer-to-peer Lookup Service for Internet Applications" by Ion Stoica , Robert Morris, David Karger, M. Frans Kaashoek and Hari Balakrishna.

This implementation of a DHT can be used to tranfer files accross computers, using a distributed hash table with failure resistance in case a client (node) leaves.
